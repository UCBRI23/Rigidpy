# RigidPy

`RigidPy` is a library written in python with minimal dependency to compute
rigidity properties of a graph/network. The namespace is designed to
resemble mathematical terminology unifying the research themes in mathematics,
physics and biology.
The library can be used to compute the rigidity matrix, vibrational properties,
and elastic properties of the spring networks. The library also offers a set of
tools to find different realizations of a graph for a given topology.
