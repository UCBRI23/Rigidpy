# Rigidpy


RigidPy is a library written in python to compute rigidity of a graph. The namespace is designed to resemble mathematical terminology. The library can be used to compute rigidity matrix, vibrational modes and different realizations of a graph. In particular, the library makes it easy to study spring networks and their elastic properties.
